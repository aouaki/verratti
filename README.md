#Shake Your Team

A simple app to gather the latest trends from a given soccer game on Twitter and to fight for the popularity of your team by shaking your phone.

The application uses a websocket with the server since Twitter API cannot be called by a client. The source code for the server end (API to get tweets and votes) used by Shake your Team is in the repo aouaki/verratti. 

Shake Your Team is a mobile webapp using AngularJS+Twitter Bootstrap and Cordova.

The project was made for a school project with the startup Footbar (http://www.footbar.fr), for testing Twitter way to provide an efficient mobile application to follow amateur soccer games.
